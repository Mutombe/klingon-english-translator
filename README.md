# klingon-english-translator
A dumb way to make a Klingon to English translator  with a CLI


python translation_program.py <arguments>
```

Replace `<arguments>` with the appropriate command and options based on what you want to do. Here are some examples:

- To translate a word from English to Klingon:
  ```
  python translation_program.py hello -e
  ```

- To conjugate a verb in a specific tense:
  ```
  python translation_program.py eat -c present
  ```

- To generate flashcards for practicing Klingon:
  ```
  python translation_program.py -f 5
  ```

- To load translations from the CSV file and then perform a translation:
  ```
  python translation_program.py cat -e -l data.csv
  ```

Make sure to adjust the commands and options according to your requirements.
